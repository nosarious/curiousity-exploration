# curiousity-exploration
inspired by datawalking, this collects data while wandering through locations driven only by curiousity

this code base and stored information from walks uses a raspberry pi and grovepi system of sensors to collect information anonymously for later reference.

the information includes temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, light (brightness) and sound (loudness) and potentially GPS coordinates.

This coincides with an art installation that will tentatively be called "Inadequate Descriptions", an exploration of how our experience of a place will be different than our limited methods of describing it to other people.
